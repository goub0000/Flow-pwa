**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Critical Issue**: All onboarding pages included account creation/signup steps, but users are ALREADY logged in when they access onboarding.

// Example from students onboarding
const profileData = {
  accountType: 'student',
  firstName: formData.firstName || '',
  lastName: formData.lastName || '',
  displayName: `${formData.firstName} ${formData.lastName}`.trim(),

2. **Add skip options**: Let users skip optional steps more easily
3. **Improve mobile responsiveness**: Some forms could be more mobile-friendly
4. **Add field validation**: Real-time validation feedback for better UX
5. **Add help tooltips**: Contextual help for complex fields
6. **Internationalization**: Full i18n support for multi-language

### Data Privacy Notes:

- Users no longer asked to upload sensitive ID documents during onboarding
- Identity verification handled at authentication stage, not onboarding
- Appropriate for post-login profile completion flow
