## 📊 How It Works Now

### For Students

**Programs Page** (`/students/programs.html`):
- Shows ALL programs from ALL institutions in Firestore
- Displays: program name, institution, tuition, requirements, available spots
- Filter by country, degree level, max tuition
- Click "Apply Now" to create an application
- If no programs exist → Shows empty state

**Dashboard** (`/students/`):
- Fetches real application stats from Firestore
- Shows: Total, Draft, Submitted, Accepted applications
- If no applications → Shows 0 (correct behavior)

**Apply to Program**:
1. Click "Apply Now" on any program
2. System creates application in Firestore
3. Redirects to applications page
4. Dashboard automatically updates

### For Institutions

**Dashboard** (`/institutions/`):
- Fetches real data from Firestore
- Shows: Total Applications, Pending Reviews, Active Programs, Fill Rate
- All calculated from actual database data

**Programs Page** (`/institutions/programs.html`):
- Shows institution's own programs
- Ability to create, edit, delete programs
- Real-time updates

**Creating Programs**:
- Use browser console with `init-sample-data.js` script
- Or build UI for program creation

### For Counselors, Parents, Recommenders
- All dashboards fetch real data
- Show statistics based on their relationships (students, children)
- Professional empty states if no data

## 🚀 Next Steps - Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Sample Data

1. **Go to**: https://flow-pwa.web.app/auth/
2. **Login as institution**: `ogouba3@gmail.com` (or your institution account)
3. **Open browser console** (F12)
4. **Run this code**:

```javascript
// Load initialization script
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/assets/js/init-sample-data.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);

// Wait 2 seconds, then create programs
setTimeout(() => {
  FlowInitializer.initializePrograms();
}, 2000);
```

5. **Verify**: You should see success messages for 6 programs created

### Step 2: Test as Student

1. **Logout** from institution account
2. **Register** new student: https://flow-pwa.web.app/auth/register.html
3. **Complete onboarding**
4. **Browse programs**: https://flow-pwa.web.app/students/programs.html
5. **See real programs** from the institution you created
6. **Click "Apply Now"** on any program
7. **Check dashboard** - should show 1 application

### Step 3: Verify Institution Dashboard

1. **Logout and login** as institution again
2. **Go to dashboard**: https://flow-pwa.web.app/institutions/
3. **Should see**:
   - Active Programs: 6
   - Total Applications: 1 (from the student)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Programs Not Showing?
1. **Check if programs exist**: Open Firebase Console → Firestore → `programs` collection
2. **Check if you're logged in**: Open console → `window.FlowAuth.isAuthenticated()`
3. **Clear cache**: `window.DataService.clearCache()`
4. **Check console for errors**: Press F12, look for red errors

### Can't Create Applications?
1. **Verify you're a student**: `window.FlowAuth.getUserProfile().accountType`
2. **Check Firestore rules**: Should allow students to create applications
3. **Check program exists**: Program must be in database and active

### Dashboard Shows All Zeros?
1. **Wait 5 minutes** (cache TTL) or clear cache
2. **Create some data** using the initialization script
3. **Reload dashboard**: `window.reloadDashboard()`

### Permission Denied Errors?
1. **Redeploy rules**: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. **Wait a few minutes** for propagation
3. **Check account type** matches what you're trying to access

## 🎓 Professional Behavior

**Important**: The app now works like a real production system:

- **No data = Empty state** (not a bug!)
- **Students see nothing** until institutions create programs
- **Institutions see nothing** until students apply
- **Dashboards show 0s** until there's real activity

This is **correct, professional behavior**. The app is ready for production use!
